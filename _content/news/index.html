					<h4>New integration: <strong>MacroPilot</strong> <small>May 2015</small></h4>
					<p>We can now integrate with even the oldest and most uncompliant systems, or those which you would need to buy expensive licenses for in order to enable the web services or other integration points.</p><p>MacroPilot is a safety net for such scenarios. It can replicate the human actions on a graphical user interface such as button clicks, keyboard input, form field entries. And it can do all this in a scripted &amp; automated fashion. Training the MacroPilot is a very simple &ldquo;screen recording&rdquo; procedure which takes just a few minutes, after which the macro can be repeatedly played back thousands of times per day (with different input parameters).</p>
