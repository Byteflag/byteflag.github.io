				Our company is growing. We have just <strong>won several big new projects</strong> and need to hire some additional software engineers to join our team.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ideal person for us is somebody with <strong>copious amounts of .NET experience</strong>, demonstrable <strong>coding passion</strong> and a growing interest in <strong>functional programming</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our stack is changing over time, which you will be able to influence, but currently we use a stack of <strong>MacBook Pro</strong>'s, <strong>VMware Fusion</strong>, <strong>Visual Studio</strong> and <strong>Xamarin Studio</strong> all tied together with some lovely <strong>F# .NET</strong> source code. We also use AngularJS for some of our other projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				We would usually expect you to:
				<ul>
					<li>Be degree educated.</li>
					<li>Have some open source projects or contributions or at least be able to speak passionately about some software project you've worked on.</li>
					<li>Have at least 1 to 3 years of professional experience.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Our central base is London and that's where formal meetings or social events would usually be held but we could also accommodate a candidate around the Cambridge area.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over the coming months we are likely going to be adopting the WebSharper stack for some development of web-based administration control panels and a reporting portal.
			</p>

			<p>
				You will not just be a software developer, but also a "technical fellow" of our company. This is not a corporate job: you will be given the opportunity to lead, manage and develop entire projects from start to finish, lend your experience and expertise to all areas of the business. You won't just be another cog in a large machine!
			</p>
			<p>
				We are accepting applications over a broad range of skill and experience levels; from junior, senior and even to architect level developers.
			</p>
			<p>
