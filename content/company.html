					Our company's inception
				</h1>

			<p>
				Byteflag was founded by Nathan Evans and Nas Hayat. In the summer of 2013, the number 1 supplier of SMS text messaging technology in the social housing and local authorities sector of the United Kingdom was a company called Deeplake. After 6 years of our founders running that company and taking it to its absolute peak, it was recognised that SMS technology was both being commoditised by larger vendors like Capita and Orchard in that sector, as well as being supplanted as a technology by better alternatives in the shape of mobile apps, tablet PCs and smartphones.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sensing an opportunity to re-enter the same market with next generation mobile working technology, Deeplake was sold and Byteflag was formed along with a market-centric sales arm called Housing Insight.
			</p>
			<p>
				After spending 2013 in intensive development, by March 2014 our first product, PanConnect Self-Service was ready for launch. By the summer of 2014 our PanConnect Mobile solution was also ready for launch.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, Byteflag is continuing intensive development of PanConnect to take it to new heights and new markets.
