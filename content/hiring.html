				Byteflag is growing. We have just <strong>won some big new customers</strong> and need to hire an additional software engineer to join our distributed team.
			</p>
			<p>
				The ideal person for us is somebody with <strong>copious amounts of .NET experience</strong>, demonstrable <strong>coding passion</strong>, and a severe interest in <strong>functional programming</strong>.
				We don't really mind what languages you're most familiar with today as we believe in polyglot programming. Always pick the best tools for the job.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our stack is always changing over time, which you can surely help with, but currently we use a stack of <strong>MacBook Pro</strong>'s, <strong>VMware Fusion</strong>, <strong>Visual Studio</strong> and <strong>Xamarin Studio</strong> all tied together with some lovely <strong>F# .NET</strong> source code.
			</p>
			<p>
				We would expect you to be degree educated, have some open source projects or contributions, and have worked in the industry for at least 3 to 5 years since graduation.
				Since our team is currently comprised of <strong>distributed</strong>, you would need to be okay with that. Though our central base in <strong>London</strong> and that's where any formal meetings or social events would happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				We realise that often the biggest drawback of distributed teams is being stuck working from home. Not with us. Providing you live in a city we can almost certainly get you a shared office space to work from.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're interested, please get in touch.
